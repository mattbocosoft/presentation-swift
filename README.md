# Swift Programming Language  

Swift is a relatively new programming language designed by [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner) and other developers at Apple. The language began to be developed in 2010 and was announced to the public in June 2014. Since then, the language has undergone many changes to harden its syntax and semantics through a series of public betas. Swift is the *eventual* replacement for Objective-C, the programming language that [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT) began using it in the 1980s and Apple later began using when Apple acquired NeXT.  

 Swift is multi-[paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) (e.g. Imperative, Functional, Object-Oriented, etc.) programming languages that has taken many of the best aspects of Objective-C and added safe programming patterns and modern features.
