#Classes  

Classes help developers abstract away complexity and expose a simplified interface on top of potentially complex logic. Swift uses a single implementation file (*classname.swift*) instead of two separate files (header and implementation).  

###Initializers  

Unlike in Objective-C, Swift initializers do not return a value. All stored non-optional properties must be initialized before the initializer chain is complete, otherwise a compile-time error will be generated.
