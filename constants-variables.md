#Constants and Variables  

**Constants** and **Variables** divide values into either mutable or immutable:  
```
let myImmutableNumber = 42 // Cannot be modified
var myMutableNumber = 24   // Can be modified
```

If you do not need to modify a variable after it is first set, then use a constant instead of a variable. The helps to ensure code-safety as well as removed unnecessary overheard associated with mutable variables.  

One unique feature of Swift is that constant and variable names can even contain unicode characters, opening up the door to Unicode:  

```
let Ï€ = 3.14159
let ä½ å¥½ä¸–ç•Œ = "Hello World"
let ðŸŒ² = "Evergreen"
```

###Optionals
Optionals are one of the most powerful features of Swift and contribute to the language's safety features. An optional can either say that there *is a value and it's x* or that *there is no value*. Optionals are similar to nullable pointers in Objective-C except that they apply to all types and not just classes.

Declare an *optional* constant or variable by adding a question mark (?) after the variable name:  
```
let name? = "George"
var possibleAge?
```

###Unwrapping Optionals  
Optional values must be unwrapped before being referenced later on. This can be done using optional binding: 
```
if let actualAge = possibleAge {
  // The age value is present
} else {
  // No age has been set
}
```

Multiple optionals can be bound at the same time:  
```
if let actualAge = possibleAge, actualName = possibleAge {
  // All optionals have been successfully bound
} else {
  // One of the optionals above does not have a value
}
```

If you know for a fact that an optional contains a value, then you can explicitly unwrap it using an exclamation mark:  
```
let actualAge = possibleAge!
```

Alternatively, an optionals can be declared with the exclamation mark in place so that they are *implicitly unwrapped*, which is a feature primarily used during class initialization:
```
var possibleAge!

init() {
  possibleAge = 42
}
```

Implicitly unwrapped optionals do not need to use optional binding or unwrapping.  

Optionals can be set back to nil `possibleAge = nil` while non-optionals *cannot be set to nil*.  

Optionals can be a difficult concept to pick up on immediately.

###Optional Chaining  

In order to aleviate chains of optional binding, the architects of Swift added optional chaining which provides the convenience of not needing to check intermediate optionals in a chain of optionals. Optional chaining can be used by adding a question mark after each optional in the chain:  
```
let possibleAge = organization?.management?.ceo?.age
```
